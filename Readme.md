## Steps before running the project

1. Create a virtual enviroment.
2. Install all the dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##

## As OpenAI doesnt let me post the secret key on any github repository or email, you will have to use your own secret key.

(As soon as i push my github repo with the API in .env file, the OpenAI knows and the secret key gets disabled )

1. Change the secret key in .env file

```
GPT_KEY='your secret key'
```

Now the project should run as expected .
